# 4 main data types in python:
int # 0 1 2 69 etc
str # Strings can be typed using ' ' or using " " when we want ' ' inside " ": So 'Tim' and "Tim" both work fine
bool # True and False - Always start with capitals
float # .001 .045 etc

# Variables:
name = "tim"
# To access the variable
print(name)
name = "bob" # To change the variable simply reassign it
